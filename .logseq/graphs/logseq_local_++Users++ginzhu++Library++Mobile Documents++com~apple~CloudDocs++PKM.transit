True leaders make themselves redundant; of this I am proud, as that much at least I've achieved. I am leaving you in the capable hands of Alex, Carlos, Georgi, Robin, Marty, Pavlina, Lina, Ivo, Ilko, Brani, Kris, Tony, Niki and their wider leadership teams. They are the people that will spread this business far and wide, and grow it internationally. Iva & Nikos will lead teams in the wider SoftwareONE business, beyond the AWS remit, and we all know they are going to make tremendous impact in their new roles. And you are all going to shine, and I am proud of each and everyone of you. I know you will be very successful in the new organisation, because of who you are, how you work, and what you know.\n- One of the most amazing individuals that I've met is Joost: knowledgeable, hard-working, methodical, composed, focused on outcomes. He and his wider integration team have done a great job to make SoftwareONE our new home. Please join me in thanking him and assisting him to complete the integration.\n- I don't want to say goodbye, and I won't. I will be your biggest supporter and continue to cheer you and celebrate your successes but I'll just do it from the sidelines. I am sure we'll cross paths again: do business together, partner, or simply meet socially to remember the olden days. When you need me, I will be there for you.\n- Warmest regards, and please stay in touch.\n  -- Dob\n-\n- Company Handbooks, some ready to use templates for startup operations: #startup #startup-handbooks\n  https://posthog.com/handbook\n  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/\n-\n- https://chainstack.com/pricing/ #startup-competition #startup\n- Blockchain infrastructure provider #startup #startup-ideas\n- Cloud adoption company - cloud comparison between various cloud vendors.

Focus on global/regional markets. Innovation is not necessary to SME establishment and growth, nor is competitive advantage. The company is based on some sort of innovation (tech, business process, model) and potential competitive advantage. “Non-tradable jobs”—jobs generally performed locally (e.g., restaurants, dry cleaners, and service industry). “Tradable jobs”—jobs that do not have to be performed locally. Most often family businesses or businesses with very little external capital. More diverse ownership base including a wide array of external capital providers. The company typically grows at a linear rate. When you put money into the company, the system (revenue, cash flow, jobs, etc.) will respond quickly in a positive manner. The company starts by losing money, but if successful will have exponential growth. Requires investment. When you put money into the company, the revenue/cash flow/jobs numbers do not respond quickly.

The research at MIT suggests that businesses with multiple founders are more successful than those founded by an individual.2 There are many resources that go into more depth about finding good co-founders. Probably the single best and most rigorous book on this topic is Harvard Professor Noam Wasserman’s book, The Founder’s Dilemmas. For other valuable perspectives, here are a few articles that may be helpful: Paul Graham, “What We Look for in Founders,” PaulGraham.com, October 2010, www.paulgraham.com/founders.html.

You should be able to sum up your idea, technology, or interest in one succinct sentence. Idea: Technology: Passion: “I want to start a company in Africa that will create a sustainable business model to improve life for the people there and empower them with jobs.” Here, the idea is that a sustainable business model will reduce poverty in Africa more effectively than charitable contributions to the poor. This sentence is enough to move on to the next step of Market Segmentation, though as you will see, you will have to be much more specific before you can turn the idea into a business. “I have a robot that allows you to feel objects rendered by a computer.” This statement radiates with potential. How could someone benefit from being able to have a three-dimensional object on their computer screen and still be able to feel it, in some way, in physical space? I co-founded a company, SensAble Technologies, around this very technology, and throughout the book, I share SensAble’s story. “I have a master’s in mechanical engineering and I can quickly prototype most any technological gadget you want . . . now I want to put my skills to use in the most impactful way possible, and be my own boss.” This person has identified a personal comparative advantage, the ability to prototype gadgets quickly, which can help a business go through product iterations faster. The person may want to consider a hardware-based business, as it would line up well with the comparative advantage.

You must be fearless about getting on the phone, in the car, or on a plane to pursue this information. You must have an ability to listen and get people to talk. You must be open-minded and unbiased, and never presuppose a solution (inquiry, not advocacy). You must have the ability to explain what the essence of your proposed offering might look like while also being flexible.

Your potential customers do not have “the answer” for you. 3. Talk with potential customers in “inquiry” mode, not “advocacy/sales” mode.

You should be able to sum up your idea, technology, or interest in one succinct sentence. Idea: Technology: Passion: “I want to start a company in Africa that will create a sustainable business model to improve life for the people there and empower them with jobs.” Here, the idea is that a sustainable business model will reduce poverty in Africa more effectively than charitable contributions to the poor. This sentence is enough to move on to the next step of Market Segmentation, though as you will see, you will have to be much more specific before you can turn the idea into a business. “I have a robot that allows you to feel objects rendered by a computer.” This statement radiates with potential. How could someone benefit from being able to have a three-dimensional object on their computer screen and still be able to feel it, in some way, in physical space? I co-founded a company, SensAble Technologies, around this very technology, and throughout the book, I share SensAble’s story. “I have a master’s in mechanical engineering and I can quickly prototype most any technological gadget you want . . . now I want to put my skills to use in the most impactful way possible, and be my own boss.” This person has identified a personal comparative advantage, the ability to prototype gadgets quickly, which can help a business go through product iterations faster. The person may want to consider a hardware-based business, as it would line up well with the comparative advantage.

([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282748758994946))\n\t- Let’s look at this using $SOL as an example on a high time frame. \n\t  \n\t  1. Speculative buyers and insiders buy in. \n\t  \n\t  2. Retail gets involved. \n\t  \n\t  3. VCs and early buyers exit. \n\t  \n\t  4. Accumulation phase commences. \n\t  \n\t  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FgAOQ4tUUAADmv6.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282759009763328))\n\t- This 4 stage cycle can happen over any time frame. \n\t  \n\t  We can observe this cycle playing out over days, weeks, months, or years. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282764122689540))\n\t- There’s nothing wrong with buying a coin in ANY of these phases. \n\t  \n\t  But, your position size will vary significantly depending on what stage we’re in. \n\t  \n\t  And that is the key to effective DCAing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282767956287489))\n\t- During the “Speculation Phase”, you can start placing bets on a project if you really like it. \n\t  \n\t  This phase applies to new projects, which haven’t proven themselves in the market yet. \n\t  \n\t  E.g $DOT in 2020, $SOL in 2020, $GMX earlier this year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282771810779137))\n\t- Next comes the “Retail Zone”, which isn’t an ideal time to buy. \n\t  \n\t  Yes, you can make crazy gains here. \n\t  \n\t  But in general, buying into hype is a bad idea. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282775375966208))\n\t- One coin I’d consider to be in this zone right now is $QNT. \n\t  \n\t  Good fundamentals? Yes. \n\t  \n\t  Good time to buy? (Imo no). \n\t  \n\t  Just because a project has good fundamentals doesn’t mean you can buy it at any time. \n\t  \n\t  Yes, I may miss a further pump. But I have rules, and I stick to them. \n\t  \n\t  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FgAOSaBUoAIEi2b.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282785702334466))\n\t- However, if I’m helplessly desperate to FOMO, then I’ll allow myself to buy 30% of my ideal position. \n\t  \n\t  That way, I’m at ease mentally. \n\t  \n\t  I did this with $GNS a couple weeks ago (despite it being in the early stages of the “Retail Zone” imo). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282791075303424))\n\t- The next phase, the “Offloading Stage”, is the WORST time to buy. \n\t  \n\t  Why? \n\t  \n\t  Because risk/reward is at its lowest. \n\t  \n\t  You’re essentially trying to catch a falling knife. \n\t  \n\t  Occasionally you’ll catch a dip before a quick pump, but if the trend is down - you should honour the trend. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282795106029569))\n\t- Once price action starts to settle, we’ve officially entered the “Accumulation Phase”. \n\t  \n\t  This is the time where speculation and hype is gone. \n\t  \n\t  Your BIGGEST size kicks in during this phase (this is the best risk/reward time to enter). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282798788616195))\n\t- A token is ONLY in accumulation if it has been going sideways for an extended amount of time. \n\t  \n\t  $QRDO is an example of this. \n\t  \n\t  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FgAOTuvVQAAi1Ll.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282807063932928))\n\t- If a token is still in a downtrend, it’s not in the “Accumulation Phase”.\n\t  \n\t  Tokens that HAVE gone through all 3 phases and reach the “Accumulation Phase”, are the type of tokens we’re looking at buying. \n\t  \n\t  Ofc strong fundamentals + potential future narratives are an absolute must. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282811480535041))\n\t- A few examples of these: \n\t  \n\t  $SOL\n\t  $DYDX\n\t  $BIFI \n\t  \n\t  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FgAOUdzUUAIl8rL.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282819583983616))\n\t- Remember, some tokens never get out of this phase. \n\t  \n\t  There’s no guarantee they will go up just because they’re in accumulation. \n\t  \n\t  There’s countless projects that peaked in 2017 and have been in accumulation ever since. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282823723704320))\n\t- This is why the first and foremost criteria is finding a project with strong fundamentals and strong potential future narratives. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282827297337345))\n\t- This is why position sizing is so crucial. \n\t  \n\t  You might want to deploy 70% of your ideal position in the “Accumulation Phase”, but the frequency and duration of your buys will depend on your: \n\t  \n\t  • Cash flow\n\t  • Outlook\n\t  • Risk tolerance \n\t  • Time horizon ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282835371282433))\n\t- I can’t give you exact specifics as everyone’s situation varies. \n\t  \n\t  But I hope this thread serves as a useful bear market accumulation guide (especially for small cap gems + quality fundamental projects). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1585282838730985472))\n\t- TLDR: \n\t  \n\t  • Identify tokens with great fundamentals, and strong potential future narratives. \n\t  \n\t  • Look for projects that have gone through the 3 phases, and are now in the “Accumulation Phase”. \n\t  \n\t  • Create and execute an accumulation strategy based on this information.

([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=199))\n\t- Falling prey to the “action imperative.” ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=202))\n\t- Setting unrealistic expectations. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=204))\n\t- Attempting to do too much. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=206))\n\t- Coming in with “the” answer. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=208))\n\t- Engaging in the wrong type of learning. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=211))\n\t- Neglecting horizontal relationships. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=214))\n\t- Leadership ultimately is about influence and leverage. You are, after all, only one person. To be successful, you need to mobilize the energy of many others in your organization. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=234))\n\t- In the first few weeks, you need to identify opportunities to build personal credibility. In the first 90 days, you need to identify ways to create value and improve business results that will help you get to the break-even point more rapidly. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=260))\n\t- You therefore should start right away to identify those whose support is essential for your success, and to figure out how to line them up on your side. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=273))\n\t- you build a team of competent people whom you trust, you establish goals and metrics to monitor their progress, you translate higher-level goals into specific responsibilities for your direct reports, and you reinforce them through process. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=389))\n\t- Decision making becomes more political—less about authority, and more about influence. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=398))\n\t- To overcome these barriers and succeed in joining a new company, you should focus on four pillars of effective onboarding: business orientation, stakeholder connection, alignment of expectations, and cultural adaptation. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=481))\n- New highlights added [[Nov 9th, 2022]] at 5:32 AM [[manager-onboarding]]\n\t- Onboarding checklists Business orientation checklist As early as possible, get access to publicly available information about financials, products, strategy, and brands. Identify additional sources of information, such as websites and analyst reports. If appropriate for your level, ask the business to assemble a briefing book. If possible, schedule familiarization tours of key facilities before the formal start date. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=551))\n\t- Stakeholder connection checklist ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=556))\n\t- Ask your boss to identify and introduce you to the key people you should connect with early on. If possible, meet with some stakeholders before the formal start. Take control of your calendar, and schedule early meetings with key stakeholders. Be careful to focus on lateral relationships (peers, others) and not only vertical ones (boss, direct reports). Expectations alignment checklist Understand and engage in business planning and performance management. No matter how well you think you understand what you need to do, schedule a conversation with your boss about expectations in your first week. Have explicit conversations about working styles with bosses and direct reports as early as possible. Cultural adaptation checklist During recruiting, ask questions about the organization’s culture. Schedule conversations with your new boss and HR to discuss work culture, and check back with them regularly. Identify people inside the organization who could serve as culture interpreters. After thirty days, conduct an informal 360-degree check-in with your boss and peers to gauge how adaptation is proceeding. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=556))\n\t- Effective leaders strike the right balance between doing (making things happen) and being (observing and reflecting). ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=743))\n\t- Remember: simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand translates into increased credibility and influence. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=746))\n\t- What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing (or will face in the near future)? ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=879))\n\t- Why is the organization facing (or going to face) these challenges? ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=880))\n\t- What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth? ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B6U63ZE&location=880))\n\t- What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these opportunities?

Schedule conversations with your new boss and HR to discuss work culture, and check back with them regularly. Identify people inside the organization who could serve as culture interpreters. After thirty days, conduct an informal 360-degree check-in with your boss and peers to gauge how adaptation is proceeding.

([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacnBTC/status/1568705900281470979))\n\t- Importance of tracking and researching newly listed coins mainly focusing on Binance.\n\t  \n\t  History doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes. \n\t  \n\t  There are few times a year where the market literally drops you free money and you just have to pay attention and pick it up. \n\t  \n\t  Let me explain.. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacnBTC/status/1568705901841813507))\n\t- It’s a fact that people like new stuff.\n\t  \n\t  Newly listed coins that have their primary listing on Binance can make us a lot of money. \n\t  \n\t  They have fresh charts, often cliffed unlocks (meaning investors are locked for the first months of trading) and can form new narratives easily. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacnBTC/status/1568705903217582081))\n\t- Okay alright newly listed coins ✅\n\t  \n\t  but we have to know how to differentiate winners from losers…\n\t  \n\t  First off in my last Tradingview guide I taught you how to create watchlists.

For each newly listed asset we want to research and know the following about the token metrics:\n\t  \n\t  • Seed/Private Round unlock schedule\n\t  • Price per token for seed round/private round and other rounds\n\t  • Investors/advisors/team ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacnBTC/status/1568705917515956226))\n\t- Let's cover the token unlock schedules. New assets where there is a long unlock schedule/investors being locked are attractive to us. \n\t  \n\t  Let me show you an example. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacnBTC/status/1568705918958804993))\n\t- This is the $GMT unlock schedule. As you can see all seed/private/advisor/team rounds are locked till Feb 2023.\n\t  \n\t  I was shilling $STEPN and $GMT recklessly before it did x10 because simply because based on these token metrics and the market being quiet I knew it would print money. \n\t  \n\t  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcUlhpXWYAcLIW9.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacnBTC/status/1568705922184220680))\n\t- This is the $GMT unlock schedule.
